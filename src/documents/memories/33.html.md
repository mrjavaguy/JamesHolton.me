> I was greatly shocked and saddened to hear of Jim's untimely death. I send my deepest condolences to all his family and colleagues. <br /><br />I first met Jim in Cambridge, UK, in 1973, and even now I recall him bouncing up and introducing himself. As a young graduate student I felt greatly honoured to have a leading meteorologist like Jim take a lively interest in my research. Over the decades since then, Jim has continued to be a source of encouragement and inspiration to me. <br /><br />I have not seen Jim a great deal in recent times, but on the occasions when we did meet I was always delighted to find how he never seemed to age - he always retained that youthful and energetic appearance, and that terrific sense of humour. We had some great laughs together. <br /><br />Jim was a wonderful man and a great scientist. He will be sorely missed by numerous friends and colleagues. I am proud to have known him. <br />
