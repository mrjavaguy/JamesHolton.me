> I met Jim in 1983 when I went to University of Washington as graduate student. I had known his name by his famous textbook, and that was one of the reasons I chose UW. Jim became my supervisor, and I enjoyed the relationship with him very much. He was always very generous to me. In the Confucian philosophy one's teacher is like one's father and king. When I told him about that philosophy, he told me he preferred king, jokingly. He was always very supportive even after I left UW.<br /><br />I am really sorry I missed opportunity inviting him to Korea. A few years ago, I asked him if he wanted to come to korea to give a lecture series. He was very busy at the time working as Chairman of the Department, and we had postponed the plan. I was considering to organize Jim Holton's summer lecture at Seoul in a year or two. I wish I had invited him earlier. Since he was so healthy, I thought he would be always around.<br />I will miss him.<br />
