> Jim, I must have thought you'd always be around. You were there as the author of the first meteorology textbook I ever read. You and Margaret were there to welcome a young single assistant professor into the department with many fun and fine dinners at your home. You were so generous with your time, so ready to answer questions or to offer good advice. You were always happy to spend an hour visiting with students and colleagues over beer and chips. You never shied away from the less pleasant tasks needed to keep the department going. You were probably the only faculty member who always submitted his qualifying exam questions on time. You were a terrific example as a great scientist and a great man. <br /><br />You looked like you'd always be around, hardly seeming to age or lose a step in the 16 years I've known you. Like your family and so many friends, I wish my casual assumption was true -- I so wish I could find your smiling face around the department tomorrow. <br /><br />Dale Durran
