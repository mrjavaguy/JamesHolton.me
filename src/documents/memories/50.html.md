> I got to know Jim in two happy years I spent at UW as a postdoc and was fortunate to keep in touch through scientific meetings and the like over the years (nearing 20 now) that followed. I remember joining him and his friends on midday runs from the IMA and on occasional hiking or ski trips in the Cascades. One memorable trip for me was an ascent in 1985 of Glacier Peak (via Frostbite Ridge and the Rabbit Ears) with Jim , Eric, Bill and Ulrike Criminale and Mark Baldwin. The trip was preceded by instruction from Jim and Eric in crevasse rescue, using a suitable tree in the Holton garden. Another was a day's hike in 1992 to Kyes Peak (Monte Cristo range). Jim brought along the customary photocopy of the relevant pages from Beckey's book. We got close to the summit but I for one was pleased to use the lack of clarity in Beckey as an excuse for not completing the final scramble to the top. After a very long day we returned to Jim's car, where he claimed to be in a state of exhaustion and requested me to drive him home. <br /><br />I'd like to echo what many others have said on this page. Jim was remarkable for his clarity of thought, presentation and purpose and his generosity and humour. It was truly a privilege to get to know Jim and to benefit from his encouragement, advice and friendship over the years.
