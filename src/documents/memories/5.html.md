>Seeing the pictures of Jim at work, I am reminding of spending some weekends with my father at his work. 
This was where I got my introduction to computers, starting with punch cards. 
Later I played Star Trek on a VT52 terminal in his office (on the third floor then). 
One of the first programs that I ever wrote was that Star Trek game on an Apple ][. 
Later I helped my dad move to the sixth floor, during the move I was putting years and years of National Geographics Magazines on one of the top shelves, when the shelf crash down on top of me. 
My father was so worried that I had been really hurt, but I had only minor bruises. 
When I was attending the U, my dad's office was where I went for help with the Math classes (he tended to actually be in his office unlike the TA and professors teaching the courses I was taking).
