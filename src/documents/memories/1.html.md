> My father past away last Wednesday, March 3 after being in a coma for eight days. He had been running around the track at Husky Stadium when he collapsed. Despite the best heroic efforts of his running buddies and a Student Athletic Trainer he never recovered. It is very easy to find information about his [academic][] career ([google][]). It is hard to find information about him on a personal level. I thought that I would create a posting where people could place their memories of my father.  
<br />
> One of the **most** wonderful things about Papa Jim was that he was not afraid to get down on his hands and knees play with his grandkids for hours and hours.

He will be greatly missed by his family and friends.
