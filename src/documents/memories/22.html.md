> When I first became friends with Jim in the early 1980s, he was one of the few dynamicists who came to the atmospheric chemistry meetings, and bridged the gap between the communities. In later years he used to quip that chemistry meetings were more fun than dynamics meetings because there were more women. Jim got along with everyone, but didn't suffer fools gladly. His participation always enlightened the discussion, and his ready wit kept us smiling. Jim talked often about his family, and his joy in his grandchildren shone through. I fondly remember being with Jim at the EGS in Nice last year as he shopped for a sun-dress for Bailey, and herbes de Provence for Margaret. In a recent e-mail Jim mentioned that NASA had asked him for a proposal to extend his HIRDLS work for 6 more months into 2010 to compensate for the launch delay. With his usual wit, he noted &quot;Pretty optimistic of them to imagine that either HIRDLS or I will be working in 6 years.&quot; It seems so poignant now. <br /><br />I respected and admired Jim immensely and he was my dear friend. His integrity, kindness, sense of fun, commitment to family, and zest for life were an inspiration to me.
