> My dad really enjoyed hiking, the most memorable trips that we went on were to the tops of Mt. Baker, Mt Adam and Glacier Peak. After climbing Glacier Peak the first time, my father thought that it would be a good idea if we took a course in ice climbing.  The weekend that we took the course on Mt. Baker was a meteorologist dream/nightmare, every 20 minutes or so we would get a new type of weather.  Everything from sunny and warm to snowing on us and back again.  The course was useful for me later when we were hike Mt. Adam, I was crossing a snow field on the lower part of the mountain (so we were not roped up yet), when I slipped. I managed to stop myself using the ice axe arrest that I a learned during the course.  I stopped a couple of feet from a 100' cliff.  My father managed to climb to the top of all the major volcanoes in Washington, although he was disappointed that he did not get to the top of Mt. St. Helens before it blew.
