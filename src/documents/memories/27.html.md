>Reading my aunt's posting, reminded me of the time my friends and I found a parachute in the storage area.  It was an old cargo chute, no ripcord or lines, just the canopy.  My friends were using it to jump off things holding on to the chute.  My dad was not happy to see us jumping off the roof of my friends garage.
