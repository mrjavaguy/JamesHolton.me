> I first met Jim when I picked up him at the Stony Brook train station before my PhD theis proposal defense. Jim is a giant in science, so I had thought he was tough and would ask me many questions. During about 5-minute drive from the station to Marine Science Research Center, he chatted with me like a friend. This made me much confident in the defense. To my surprise, Jim did not ask me even one question. He surprised me again in my dissertation defense. This time, Jim asked me tons of questions, including those postponed from the proposal defense. He treated young students in a special way: be encouraging and strict at proper time. <br /><br />I became his post-doc after my graduation from SUNY at Stony Brook. My time with Jim at UW definitely is the most happiest period in my life. I shared his office, his scientic insights, his smiles and his humors. Jim, I will miss you forever.
