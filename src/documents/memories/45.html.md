> Our families grew up next to each other in Seattle when I was little. My father and Mr. Holton were more or less contemporaries at the University of Washington. We visited often, even after we left Seattle. I cannot recall Mr. Holton ever saying an unkind word to me. Children and young adults need kind, sucessfull models of adulthood. Mr. Holton was one of those to me.
