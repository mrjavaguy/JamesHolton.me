> It was difficult not to brag about my brother.  But I always tried because<br />out of all of Jim's accomplishments, I think the fact that he wasn't arrogant stands out the most.  With the successful career he had and the awards he received, it seems that that would have been hard to avoid.  It took no effort on Jim's part.  Running, bicycling, hiking, skiing, mountain climbing, and probably the most rigorous of all, romping with his grandchildren, must have kept him too busy.<br /><br />I shall always be grateful that success didn't change him.
