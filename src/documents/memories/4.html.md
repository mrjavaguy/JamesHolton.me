> I, like many of my colleagues in Great Britain and around the world, was shocked and deeply saddened to hear of Jim's untimely death. I much admired his scientific ability and professional integrity, but it was his humour, his human kindness and his lack of arrogance despite his fame that bring back the fondest memories. Jim was an expert on the dynamics of so-called planetary waves in the earth's atmosphere, and was discussing some issue concerning them at a scientific meeting hosted in London by the Royal Society. After his talk, someone in the audience (apparently slightly eccentric) solemnly asked from which planet these waves came, a question which elicited a number of smug sniggers from the audience. Jim, however, dealt with the question with the utmost politeness and sincerity, leaving the questioner pleased and satisfied to have participated in the discussion. I shall greatly miss Jim, and extend my sympathies to Margaret and to the rest of Jim's family.
