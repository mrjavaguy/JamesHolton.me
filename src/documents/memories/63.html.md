> This tribute to Jim was written by my son, Aiden Krakowsky, when he was 9 years old.  His first assignment in 4th grade science was to write about what he thought of when he heard the word &quot;science&quot;.  <br /><br />9/12/02<br /><br />Thoughts about science and scientists...  When I think about science I see my cousin Jim Holton studying the clouds.  He is one of if not the best in the world at what he does.  What he does is study the climate.  He is wearing blue and has grey hair.  He is on a beach and he has sent special airplanes and balloons up to help him gather data.  He is also using a telescope.  When I grow up I might want to do what he does.  He is a very good scientist and also a very nice man.<br />       -  Aiden Krakowsky
