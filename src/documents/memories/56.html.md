> JR, I will always remember you with respect, admiration, and affection. I always enjoyed working with you. Now there will be no one on the third floor to tease about wearing the same pink shirt. <br /><br />A high point for me was when we sang a hearty &quot;I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay&quot; at Bob's house. Thanks for being down to earth and genuine, and for relating to me as a real person. I will miss that.
