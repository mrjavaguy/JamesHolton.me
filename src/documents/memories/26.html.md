>I keeping telling myself &quot;this can not be true&quot;. I remember the family Christmas party only months earlier, where a decision was made that Jims glasses had to go. So plans where made to go with him to help him pick out his new glasses. So a few weeks later the girls (Jims daughter-in-law Gretchen, Gretchen's mother Jan and myself) drove over to Jim's house and wisk him away to the optical department at Group Health. Let the fun begin!!! I'm pretty sure the customers in the optical department thought we where crazy. Come to think of it, Jim was looking at us a little funny also. We where grabbing frames left and right pushing the frames on Jims face hoping for the right one. Well it didn't take long before one pair stood out among all the rest. I remember Jim asking us several time if they really looked ok. I don't think he was use to seeing that much of his face. We all agreed he was looking pretty darn HANDSOME!!! After that it was Starbucks for everyone, Jims treat. <br />The next time I saw Jim he was wearing his new glasses, and looked very dashing. I will miss Jim very much. <br />The last time I saw Jims glasses they where sitting on his son Erics desk. The last time I saw Eric he was asking the girls how he looked in his fathers glasses.<br /><br />Alison Preusch (Gretchen Holton's sister)
