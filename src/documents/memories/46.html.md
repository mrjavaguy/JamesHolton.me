> Thousand thanks for many nice evenings with exciting discussions about atmospheric science, potential vorticity, climate change, politics and much more; and for wonderful skiing in the Cascades and the Alps, for a beautiful hike to Sahele Arm (one of Jimâ€™s favorite hikes), and for a somewhat crazy climb to Petersgrat in the Valais (please apologize the terrible map and the poor routing).
