> I received too sad news with great surprise from my Japanese colleague on my return trip by our ice breaker from Antarctica to Japan. The grief you are experiencing is hard to bear. I will never forget the time when you invited me to your home party whenever I visited Seattle, which made me relax in my life far from my home country. I enjoyed short trips in Japan and in any country with you also. <br /><br />Prof. Holton's thoughtful and heartfelt words encouraged me very much in performing my work in the field of the middle atmosphere science in the past and for ever. <br /><br />With sympathy <br />Kaoru Sato
