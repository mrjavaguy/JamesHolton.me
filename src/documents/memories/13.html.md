> For all his intensity he was deep inside a very kind soul. He could be blisteringly sarcastic but I don't ever remember feeling its sting. I found myself more than once catching on fractions of a second later than I should have to the twist his humor had taken. <br /><br />I have a few sharp memories of Jim and I from middle school through college. One night in the winter of 1958 in Pullman I gave him a ride home and he noticed and we then marveled at a great aurora directly overhead in Pullman. It slowly morphed into different shapes and forms like no aurora I had ever seen before. One late August afternoon we camped in what became a cold open shelter near a pot hole lake on a ridge east of Glacier Peak. We woke the next morning to a stunning view of Glacier Peak reflected in the almost perfectly still waters of, I think it was called, Mirror Lake. These are only two of many times he and I observed and appreciated a spectacular event together. <br /><br />I know many others will miss him, many perhaps more deeply than I, but I deeply regret that I will never see his smile nor hear his laugh again, nor share some of my life with him.
