>My name is Xun Zhu. I have been deeply saddened by the loss of Professor James R. Holton. I was very fortunate to be Jim's student while at the University of Washington from March 1983 to August 1987. Jim had been a great mentor and thesis advisor to me in those four and half years. He gave me the advice and encouragement to work on scientific problems he assigned. At the same time, he also gave me the freedom and encouragement to choose different problems I liked to work. I learnt to enjoy doing science in those four years of my graduate researches. It has been more than 16 years since I received my PhD degree under the supervision of Jim and I am still greatly enjoying my daily work of doing science. <br /><br />I was also greatly moved by Jim's care of my living at the time when it was my first time of staying away from my family in China for a long time. Margaret and Jim invited me to join their thanksgiving dinners every year. I sometimes felt that I was part of Jim's family. Jim will remain in my heart for the rest of my life. <br />
