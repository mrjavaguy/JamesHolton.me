> About five years ago, I was finishing up my M.S. in Madison Wisconsin and planning to switch schools. I got two offers from MIT and the UW. Growing up in Taiwan, I found the decision quite easy to make - we'd definitely go for a big name school. A week before the deadline for me to respond to the schools, a very dramatic change occurred, due to a call from Jim. I still remember how excited I was to receive a call from my idol. Because of the phone call, I changed my mind. I fought with my parents because they couldn't believe I was not attending MIT. <br />Since I was an undergrad, I've found lots of inspiration from his book on atmospheric dynamics, which has led me to be a dynamicist. After coming to Seattle, my respect toward him got even stronger and stronger. This will be very hard on me. When I think of him, a scene of a giant mountain comes to mind. I will continue looking to to him as always.
