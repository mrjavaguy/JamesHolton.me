>This is from an old college friend. I knew that Jim had accomplished a lot, but I did not know how much until I read Margaret's obituary. In spite of all his accomplishments he was modest. <br /><br />One of my favorite memories of Jim comes from the time when Marv (my husband) and I were planning to visit after a hiking trip in eastern Washington, Lake Chelan, I think. We got out of the woods much later than we had planned and called to say that we would stay in a hotel that night and would visit the next day. Jim answered the phone and said something like &quot;Barbara, you and I have been <br />friends for a very long time. Of course, I can get up to greet you and give you a place to sleep.&quot; Marv was reluctant because he didn't know Jim very well, but I knew that Jim meant it. We arrived about 1 a.m. to a very friendly greeting. So I understand first hand what Margaret meant when she said that Jim was a good friend. <br /><br />I have seen him only a few times since graduate school, but I will miss him too.
