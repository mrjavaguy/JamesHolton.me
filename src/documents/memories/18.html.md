> He was my thesis adviser while I was a graduate student in UW. It was more than 20 years from now. In 1993, I invited him and also Margaret to visit Taiwan for a week as the Honorable guest lectureship of NSC of Taiwan. It was a big &quot;cyclone&quot; to the meteorological community in Taiwan, especially students. They held Jim's famous textbook and asking for name signing. It was a great time and it was just like yesterday. My wife, Lisa and I would like to express our gratefulness to him for his endless support and encouragement.
