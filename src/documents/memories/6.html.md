> My relationship with Jim began at conferences on middle atmospheric dynamics in the mid-1970's and as a reviewer for my papers. Jim was a tough reviewer, and I always benefited from his input. I have always been in awe of his knowledge and his research. It is hard to count the number of Holton papers that have influenced my work. <br /><br />Jim was also a PI on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite mission(1991- present) and a CoI of the HIRDLS instrument for the Aura mission (Aura will launch this summer). When I was the UARS Project Scientist, we had some close calls with NASA HQ wanting to terminate the mission. Jim was always willing to come fly to Washington to help argue the case - and the fact that he was so well respected that he usually turned the tide. He was really a dedicated member of the Atmospheric Science community. I will miss working with Jim, and the community is certainly poorer for this loss. <br />
