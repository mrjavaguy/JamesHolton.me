> My first memory of my father is when I was about three, he took me skiing (one of his favorite sports). I did not have a good time at all (it was too cold for me). A couple of years later, he took me skiing again and I did enjoy it.  We had many years of skiing after that, I always enjoyed skiing with my father, especially in my teen years where I could out ski him :)
