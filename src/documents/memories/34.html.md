Jim Holton, a good friend of mine from Pullman, Washington, died a few days ago in Seattle. We were in Boy Scouts, Explorer Scouts and enjoyed hiking and camping together in the Cascade Mountains. This is the story of one of those trips that only he and I went on.  
<BR />
In August of 1960 Jim Holton and I decided to go on a camping trip just before school started again. This was something I did with an assortment of friends each fall. It always seemed like a great break with lots of physical work in the out-of-doors while looking at beautiful scenery before diving back into academic studies for another fall, winter and spring. Jim would be a senior at Harvard and because I had changed my major from Electrical Engineer to Physics, I had two more years to go as a physics major at Washington State College. Washington State College became Washington State University the year I graduated in 1961.  
<BR />
Jim and I left Pullman in my 1952 black four-door Oldsmobile car. We drove across the Columbia Basin and then northwest of Wenatchee, Washington, into the Cascade Mountains to hike to Image Lake. We had heard that Glacier Peak, a glacier covered volcanic cinder cone, as seen from Image Lake on Miners Ridge is one of the most beautiful mountain scenes in the world as it rises almost singularly and beautifully symmetrically out of the Cascade Mountain range. We had only three days available and hoped to see it.  
<BR />
According to maps we would start our hike at the end of an old logging and mining road that ran along Chiwana River that ended at a site name Trinity and the Red Dog Mine on current 2004 maps on www.topozone.com. In 1960 we saw buildings but no evidence that anyone was living in the area.  
<BR />
The valley we drove up was wide and relatively flat and the road was in good shape. So good we were able to drive a few miles more than the map indicated. About 3 PM we came to a slight downhill pitch that led to a homemade bridge across a creek with a slight pitch up on the other side. The bridge was constructed of two huge logs about forty feet long braced about four feet above a broad rocky creek bottom. There was very little water in the creek as it was late summer. The road bed across the bridge consisted of small logs about four to five inches in diameter that lay crosswise on the huge logs. I eased the Oldsmobile down onto the bridge and started driving across. When perhaps twenty feet out the pressure of the wheels on the small logs caused them to separate and the big heavy Oldsmobile fell a few inches downward so that the frame of the car lay on the logs with the rubber tires protruding through the log road bed. It was a little tricky getting out of the car as the road bed logs were not very much wider than the car itself. We were able to walk around on the creek bed without getting our feet wet and examine the car impaled on the bridge. It was like it was on some bizarre automotive garage grease rack in the middle of a creek. The nails or whatever had held the roadbed logs in place years ago no longer held, but the roadbed logs themselves seemed still strong. Jim and I knew we were screwed and the last place with a telephone was perhaps twenty-five miles behind us. We pondered our situation for several minutes and tried various ideas for perhaps a half-hour before we hit upon a solution. We were able to find and carry a small log over and use it as a lever arm to lift the car back up in the air so that we could move a log under a wheel. We used some rope we had with us to tie the log under that wheel to nearby roadbed logs. We did this for each of the four wheels of the car and about an hour and a half later we had the car sitting on its wheels on road bed logs again. We had enough rope with us to tie logs down so we could move the car about three feet back at a time towards where I had driven onto the bridge. We dared not continue driving backwards onto unsecured logs for fear they would spin out from under the car again. So after moving all of three feet backwards we untied the ropes and retied them to support the next move backwards of each of the four wheels of the car, another three feet. The sun had set but it was still twilight when we got the car safely off of the bridge. We congratulated ourselves, ate and slept for an early start on our hike the next morning. 
<BR />
The next morning the weather was beautiful as we hiked mostly west and a little north up the Buck Creek river valley. We started at an elevation of about 2500 feet and after hiking about 10 miles we had lunch in Buck Creek Pass at an altitude of about 5700 feet. After lunch the trail we took led north past a peak called Flower Dome to our left and another peak called Fortress Mountain on our right, to Middle Ridge which we crossed at about 6250 feet altitude. A half-mile or so further on north we crossed the Pacific Crest Trail, which ran east-west there, and continued on north to the trails beneath Mount Plummer on Miner&#8217;s Ridge and took them westward for a couple of miles to Image Lake. The day was warm and sunny as we hiked along at about 6000 feet above sea level in our shirt sleeves without coats, but clouds obscured our view of the tops of several peaks, including Glacier Peak to the west.  
<BR />
We spent a cold uncomfortable night sleeping without pads on bunk shelving in an open-front U.S. Forest Service shelter on the southwest side of Image Lake. When we got up early the next morning when we saw snow on the mountain sides across Image Lake from us. But the best part of that morning was that it was perfectly clear and we watched and I took pictures of sunrise on Glacier Peak reflected in the almost perfectly still waters of Image Lake.

<BR />
Glacier Peak was about 8 miles southwest of us across the Suiattle river valley. Its peak is 10540 feet above sea level.  
<BR />
There were several trails on the slopes leading into and out of Image Lake and we took one that led us up and east along Miner&#8217;s Ridge about two miles to Mount Plummer. The peak of Mount Plummer has an elevation 7870 feet, or about 1800 vertical feet above where we had slept at Image Lake the night before. We dropped our packs on the trail to climb Mount Plummer which was little more than a steep walk through large boulders that covered a slope for about two-hundred yards leading up to the crest of Miner&#8217;s Ridge that led to the top of Mount Plummer. The north side of Miner&#8217;s Ridge drops precipitously off in cliffs. From the top of Mount Plummer we had stunning views in all directions. I took some pictures of Glacier Peak to the west, Mount Baker to the northwest, the mountains surround Chelan Lake country to the north and the Suiattle River valley to the southwest. The trail we were hiking on passed through a long meadow covered Mount Plummer hillside that was so beautiful it seemed almost groomed. When we got back to Buck Creek Pass we again dropped our packs and hiked down about 2500 feet in elevation to see what the gravely bars of the Suiattle River looked like close up.  
<BR /> 
Late in the afternoon we returned to Buck Creek Pass and our packs and hiked the easy ten miles downhill back to our car and drove home that same evening.  
<BR /> 
We had a great time doing something that remains a beautiful memory to this day, for me. Jim loved hiking in the Cascades. After graduating from Harvard he enrolled in graduate studies at Massachusetts&#8217;s Institute of Technology and got his doctorate. Upon graduation he did a post doctorate in Sweden for a year and then took a faculty position at the University of Washington to be near his beloved Cascades hiking country. He was a member of University of Washington faculty for the last 34 years and had been Chairman of the Atmospheric Sciences department for several years. Eight days before his death he suffered a heart attack and stroke while jogging during his mid-day run.
