> I was very saddened to hear of Professor Holton's death. Two years ago I took a class based on his dynamic meteorology text.  The class was by distance education, and there were several exercises that I had trouble with, and even some questions that my instructor couldn't answer. I emailed Professor Holton and he was very kind to send  prompt responses to all questions.  I am very sorry that I will never have the chance to meet him, but he leaves an impressive legacy.
