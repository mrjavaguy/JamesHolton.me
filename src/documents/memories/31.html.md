> My famiiy and I lived next door to Jim and Margaret between 1979 and 1987; Jim was a fine neighbor; a friend with a wry wit, a warm and endearing smile; and an occasional commuter to the UW campus with me in my old Peugot. An extraordinarily accomplished scholar, Jim was amazingly unpretentious and self-effacing. It was an honor to be his friend and to have the opportunity to congratulate him on his many accomplishments. <br /><br />We shared a dislike for administrative responsibilities, but he did his share and more. I can still hear his slightly crackly voice - and expect it will stay with me a very long time as will warm memories of our friendship. He had the admiration of so many people and will be missed as friend, colleague, neighbor, and one hell of a nice guy.
