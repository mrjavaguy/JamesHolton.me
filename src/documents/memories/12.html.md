> I find Jim is still with me in my work. He is there as I am talking to the wonderful young scientists I work with; there when I write a paper, reminding me to be patient for my readers; there reminding me not to jump too far ahead when I want to skip steps in my derivation; but most importantly there reminding me what the kind of humility, integrity, and excellence I can only strive for looks like. Your daughter-in-law Gretchen's quote on the web memorial, &quot;I never met anyone who didn't like Jim Holton&quot;, is so true. But also in scientific circles, I never met anyone who didn't respect him.
