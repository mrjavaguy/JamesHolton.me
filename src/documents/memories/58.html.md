> If it were not for Jim my life would have gone in a totally different direction. I came to the UW Atmospheric Sciences department for the opportunity to learn from him, after reading his classic book and papers which were well known in Russia.  Working with Jim and Mike Wallace during my graduate studies, I learned more than intricacies of atmospheric dynamics. Jim had a unique talent for communicating complex ideas, but also for kindness and understanding that you would expect of a closest friend. Jim allowed me to telecommute for the last two years of my studies, so that I was able to follow my husband's job in Michigan and still complete my Ph.D. This wouldn't happen without Jim's support. I always admired Jim's thoughtfullness, and I will miss his very Russian-style scence of humor. He will be always remembered.
