>As a child, I adored my big brother. He mostly hung around with his own friends, but he would occasionally lead me into some type of kid-type of mischief. For example, one time he and some neighbor boys obtained a parachute. Taking turns, we strapped it on, got onto our scooters, and coasted down the very steep street next to our house. About half-way down, we pulled the ripcord, and the parachute actually opened and slowed us prior to the end of the street. I never knew if our parents were aware of that adventure. Another time, we were vacationing at Orcas Island. A bunch of kids swam out to the resort's large raft, and the boys pulled up anchor. We were headed out to sea when the adults realized what was happening. One of the fathers had to row out to pull us in. <br /><br />I rarely saw my brother once he left home for college. But my childhood adoration grew to tremendous pride and awe as awards for his work poured in over the years. I want to thank everyone who has contributed to this memorial page. All of you have helped me cope with a personal tragedy I never imagined could happen and still can't quite believe.
