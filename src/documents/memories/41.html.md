>I feel very lucky to have had Jim as an advisor and as a friend. I finished my PhD in December but had not finished learning from Jim. <br /><br />Jim taught me not to compain about my computer or I would get to see the punch cards in his desk...again. He told me to always have a glass of whiskey nearby when grading 101 papers and that maybe &quot;babbling&quot; during my defense Q&amp;A was &quot;a clever strategy--no one wanted to ask you anymore questions.&quot; Jim taught me that science isn't done until it's written down and he tried to teach me to trust myself and stop fishing for approval. Jim showed me that science is fun...and that there's more to life than science. <br /><br />Thanks, Jim. I miss you.
