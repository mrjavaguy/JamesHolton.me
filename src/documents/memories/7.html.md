> I am Fang-Ching Chien from Taiwan. I studied in UW from 1991 to 1997 for my PH. D. degree under the supervision of Prof. Cliff Mass. During the years, I got the opportunity to take 2 of Jim's courses. He was no doubt the best teacher that influenced me so much on the concept of dynamics. In Chinese, one's teacher is like his father. Jim is not only like my father, but also my grandfather because he was Cliff's teacher as well. I shall always miss Jim.
