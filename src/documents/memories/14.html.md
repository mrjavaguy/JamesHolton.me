> Jim was a highly regarded, excellent scientist. However, what I'll remember most is what a wonderful human being he was. He was generous with his time and never too busy to answer a question. He was concerned about his students and colleagues; fretted about them sometimes. He was always delighted to chat with little ones that would visit the office. I remember one Saturday when I bought my then 3 year old in, and Jim played catch with him in the hall. Jim was proud of his family, talked about them all the time, and was so thrilled when he first became a grandfather. He had a great sense of humor. He was so humble for an individual of his standing in the scientific community. I remember when he was named to the National Academy of Sciences, he was initially almost embarrassed, and wouldn't even let us take him out to lunch. I consider myself quite fortunate to have known Jim as an advisor, mentor and friend. He will be missed, but never forgotten.
