<br />We have decided to hold a get together for those with fond memories of Jim, who are unable to attend the gathering in Seattle but are able to reach Reading. This will be held on the same day as the Seattle gathering for him. <br /><br />Any who wish to attend are warmly invited. <br /><br />3 April 11:00, with coffee from 10:30 and lasting an hour or so <br /><br />Place: near or in the University of Reading <br />(exact location to be decided when numbers known, parking will be catered for) <br /><br />Memories and thoughts from all will be welcome on the day. <br />Any electronic material to be shown should preferably be sent before to Tim but could be brought on the day on a stick or CD. <br /><br />Please email either (or both) of us as soon as possible if you would like to come and are able to make it. If you are unable to come but would like to send us material for the day then please do.
