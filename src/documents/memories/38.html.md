> I have known Jim a long time - since the early 1970s. We missed each other by a few months in graduate school since he left MIT a few months before I began graduate study in meteorology, but since we worked in similar research areas, we soon became to encounter one another with regularity. <br /><br />During my lighter days (in the mass sense), we jogged together many times at meetings all over the world. With his characteristic consideration for others he would slow his pace so we could converse. I prize these and many other memories of times with Jim. He also visited my home several times and became very good friends with my wife. Jim and I spoke about atmospheric science, and Lynda and Jim spoke about her work in psychology. <br /><br />Jim’s work has been very important to me both in my teaching and research. I have taught courses using three of his books, and his works have influenced my research a great deal. <br /><br />It is almost impossible to enumerate Jim’s impressive legacies – his wonderful family, his friendships, his seminal research, his textbooks from which a generation has learned atmospheric dynamics, his students, and the research scientists who worked with him. There is no question that he left the world a better place by his presence. He will be missed by many. <br />
