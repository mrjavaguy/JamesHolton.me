> To many of us, Jim is a mentor and a giant who passed the great tradition of the Atmospheric Sciences to the younger generations through his influential textbook in dynamical meteorology. Many of us seem to know him for ages even though many of us never made his acquaintance. We who studied his book are Jim’s disciples in a broad sense. On behalf of all faculty members and students in my department, I would like to express our sincerest condolence to Margaret and other members of the family for their great loss. Jim’s name will be inscribed in our heart and in history. <br /><br />Huang-Hsiung Hsu <br />Professor and Chairman <br />Department of Atmospheric Sciences <br />National Taiwan University
