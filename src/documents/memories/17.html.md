> I can't even recall when I first met Jim. It seems like I have always known him. We arrived in Seattle in 1969 and I must have gone running with Jim right away. It seems like he was always with our group of running friends and was one of the strongest and fittest. I never felt like running with him was easy, but he seemed to run so easily and I seemed to have to struggle to keep up. The same with cycling. He was so string and never seemed to tire. I sometimes wished he would not show up because I knew he would set a fierce pace and I would be embarrassed to fall behind. I also marveled at his physique - so trim, with not a bit of fat. And he never changed or seemed to age. <br />I didn't often get to do anything alone Jim, but I still remember and value a ride we (just the two of us took a few years ago). I was training for the RAMROD and I couldn't persuade anyone to go to Rainier with me except Jim. So he and I went alone and had a great day. When we got back and I dropped him off he said, &quot;What a pleasant day we had. I really enjoyed your company&quot;. It was such a nice thing to say that I will always remember it. <br />Everyone that knows Jim praises him and has always admired him. He set the standard and it can't be equaled.
