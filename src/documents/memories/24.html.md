>The first time I met Jim was in June 1967. I had just arrived in Seattle to begin a research assistantship and Jim had arranged to meet me at his office. He was wearing an outlandish red Hawaiian style shirt and shorts that were covered with splotches of paint. He had taken a break from painting his house to greet me. Not exactly what I had expected! Jim made research very exciting. Those were the early years of his work with Lindzen on the theory for the QBO, and it was clear that Jim was having a great time. I will always carry with me Jim's enthusiasm and good humor.
